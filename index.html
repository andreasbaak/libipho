  <h1 class="page-heading">Introduction</h1>

  <p>The Linux-based indiviual photobooth (Libipho) project enables you to build your own photobooth from scratch. To this end, we give detailed instructions in both
  <a href="{{ "/hardware" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">hardware</a>
  and
  <a href="{{ "/software" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">software</a>
  setup. In particular, we provide an open source implementation of a sophisticated photobooth software hosted in github repositories (licensed under GPLv2). The software is designed with the goal of a highly efficient, zero maintenance operation mode.</p>

<p>Libipho features a photobooth containing</p>

<ul>
<li>A DSLR camera with a prime lense for optimal picture quality</li>
<li>A 10 inch high resolution tablet that serves as a display for an awesome preview experience</li>
<li>A WiFi router to enable your guests to view the up-to-date photo gallery on their smartphones or tablets</li>
<li>An embedded platform (e.g., Beaglebone Black) running a custom <a href="https://www.yoctoproject.org/">yocto</a>-based Linux operating system that hosts the Libipho software</li>
</ul>

<p>The Libipho is triggered wirelessly using a remote control for the camera.</p>

<p>In order to achieve high quality pictures, we suggest (and instruct you) to use a background canvas and an indirect flash (for example, a reflective umbrella or a large softbox). We usually use a white background canvas and flash it from behind in order to remove shadows and other imperfections of the canvas. </p>
